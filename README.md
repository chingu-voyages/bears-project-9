### 1-Description
[Horology](https://horology-bear.herokuapp.com/) is an e-commerce app for selling luxury watches. Features include account registration and user authentication, product filters, a wishlist, cart,  checkout via Stripe payments, and admin page for shop owner to manage users and products.

### 2-Technologies
  This project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [React Table](https://react-table.js.org/#/story/readme)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### 3-Challenges
The challenges we faced included losing a team member (to a new job, that is - congrats, Chris!) halfway through the project. Each of us had individual things we learned along the way as well, which included SaSS, Stripe Payments, JWT authentication, Postgres, deployment to Heroku, among others. All of us were exposed to new concepts as well as new ways of doing familiar things.

### 4-Future Development
Future development of the app would include:
- guest shopping carts and checkout
- expanding to include offering more than just watches
- perhaps a more robust CMS for the show owner/manager on the admin page.
